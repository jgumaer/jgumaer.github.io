Hello! I am Jason Gumaer, a data science consultant based out of Upstate New York with a track record of creating analyses, methodologies, and tools for the public good. I specialize in data analysis, visualization, statistics, and machine learning, particularly in public sociodemographic, temperature, and health data.

I hold a Master’s degree in Data Science from Indiana University, a Master’s degree in Mathematics from University at Albany, and a Bachelor’s degree in mathematics from SUNY Plattsburgh. I was the co-teacher for the Indiana University Master’s in Data Science capstone course, Data Science in Practice, where we sourced and implemented real-world data science projects from industry, non-profit, government, and university partners. I was also the co-teacher for Innovation for Impact, which is Indiana University’s startup incubator program in conjunction with the US Department of Defense’s Hacking for Defense program. Finally, I have a decade of experience teaching mathematics and statistics at the undergraduate level.


I have created and am currently supporting two dashboarding projects with Indiana University, the [Utility Disconnections Dashboard](https://utilitydisconnections.org/) through the [Energy Justice Lab](https://energyjustice.indiana.edu/index.html) and the Beat the Heat Dashboard through the [Healthy Cities Lab](https://healthycities.luddy.indiana.edu/).
