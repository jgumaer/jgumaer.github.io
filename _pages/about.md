Hello! I am Jason Gumaer, a data science consultant based out of Upstate New York with a track record of creating analyses, methodologies, and tools for the public good.  I specialize in data analysis, visualization, statistics, and machine learning, particularly in public socieodemographic, temperature, and health data.

I hold a Master's degrees in Data Science from Indiana University, a Master's degree in Mathematics from University at Albany, and a Bachelor's degre in mathematics from SUNY Plattbsurgh.  I was the co-teacher for the Indiana Univerisity Master's in Data Science capstone course, Data Science in Practice, where we sourced and implement real-world data science projects from industry, non-profit, government, and university partners.  I was alse the co-teacher for Innovation for Impact, which is Indiana University's startup incubator program in conjunction with the US Deperatment of Defense's Hacking for Defense program.  Finally, I have a decade of experience teaching mathematics and statistics at the undergraudate level.

I have created and am currently supporting two dashboarding projects with Indiana University, the [Utility Disconnections Dashbaord](https://utilitydisconnections.org/) through the [Energy Justic Lab](https://energyjustice.indiana.edu/index.html) and the Beat the Heat Dashboard through the [Healthy Cities Lab](https://healthycities.luddy.indiana.edu/).
